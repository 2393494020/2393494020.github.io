### 从句

- 名词性从句
  
  名词性从句包括：宾语从句、主语从句、表语从句、同位语从句。
  
  名词性从句一共有三种：that 从句、whether 从句、疑问词所引导的从句

- 定语从句

  结构：先行词 n. + 关系词 + 陈述句
  
  先行词可以是任何名词

  关系词有 which, that, who, whom, whose, why, where

  先行词 = 关系词
  
  每一个关系词必做句子成分
  
  whereby = by which

  介词提前的定语从句，结构为：介词 + which/whom

  what不可以用在定语从句中，定语从句中关系代词用that和which，两者用法上的区别主要为：

  1.that可以指人，也可以指物；which只能指物  
  2.当先行词是不定代词all, something, anything, everything, none, the one等时，只能用that  
  如： Is there anything that I can do for you?
  
  3.先行词前有形容词的最高修饰时，要用that  
  如： This is the best film that I have ever seen for years.

  4.先行词前有序数词修饰时，要用that  
  如： This is the fifth book that I have ever written.

  5.先行词前有形容词only, very, few, little等修饰时，要用that  
  如： She was the only person that was invited to the palace.

  6.先行词既指人，又指物时，只能用that  
  7.在非限制性定语从句中，只能用which  
  如： She made great progress and won a prize, which gave us a surprise.

  8.在介词+关系代词引导的定语从句中，必须用which  
  如： This is the knife with which John hurt somebody.
  
  9.当先行词本身是that的时候，要用which  
  如： The predicate is that which is said of the subject.

--|限定性定语从句|非限定性定语从句
--|--|--
逗号|无逗号|有逗号
先行词|范围不明确|范围明确
作用|修饰、限定先行词的范围；从句不能省略|补充说明先行词，从句可以省略
翻译|翻译成前置定语|不用往前翻译
关系词|作宾语可以省略；指人作宾语，who/whom/that都可以用|不能用that；作宾语不可以省略；指人作宾语，只能用whom；如果修饰整句话，只能用which/as
